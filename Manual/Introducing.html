<h1 align="center">Introducing Structorian</h1>
<h2>1. What is Structorian</h2>
<p>Structorian is essentially a universal viewer and editor for structured 
binary data. This means that Structorian is able to load a binary <i>data file</i> 
and present its contents according to the format defined in a <i>structure 
definition file</i>. Structure definition files are simple text scripts that 
define the layout of binary data structures in data files. The format of 
structure definitions supported by Structorian is very powerful and allows to 
represent even the most complex data formats with dynamic layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Structorian has the following main uses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The foremost use of Structorian is reverse engineering file formats and 
  network protocols. Reverse engineering file formats is essential when it is 
  necessary to achieve interoperability with a program that uses a proprietary 
  and undocumented file&nbsp; format.</li>
  <li>Structorian can also be a major aid when writing code dealing with known 
  and documented file formats. You will be able to see how the file structure 
  applies to actual data, and this will help you to understand the format much 
  more easily.</li>
  <li>Even when you design your own file formats and develop code for working 
  with those formats, Structorian can come in handy. Wherever your code writes 
  files that you can't read back, viewing the files with Structorian will help 
  you to see where exactly the data is broken.</li>
  <li>The editing features of Structorian, although limited, may be useful for 
  quickly patching a few bytes in a file when a full-featured editor is not 
  available. Editing features also help to reverse-engineer file formats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Structures and Fields</h2>
<p>Essentially, Structorian represents a data file as a tree of <i>structures</i> 
consisting of <i>fields</i>. There are two main types of fields: <i>visible</i> 
and <i>hidden</i>. Visible fields are basic units of data shown to the user: 
integers, strings, dates and so on. On the other hand, hidden fields contain 
instructions describing how other fields are processed: conditions, loops, 
references to other structures and so on. A structure is just a sequence of 
fields grouped under a common name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Let's start with a simple example: the BMP file format. The format is 
well described in the Microsoft documentation, and you certainly have some .BMP 
files lying in your Windows directory, so you can easily follow the tutorial.</p>
<p>Open Notepad and type (or paste) the following text. (You can find all of the 
examples given below in the Manual directory, if you do not want to type them 
yourself.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>struct BITMAPFILEHEADER
{
  str [len=2] bfType;
  u32 bfSize;
  u16 bfReserved1;
  u16 bfReserved2;
  x32 bfOffBits;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Save it as bmp1.strs.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have just created your first structure definition file, 
complete and readable by Structorian. If you are eager to try it out, just 
follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run Structorian</li>
  <li>Click the leftmost button on the toolbar, &quot;Load structure definitions&quot;.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder where you saved the file and double-click it.</li>
  <li>Click the third toolbar button, &quot;Load data file&quot;.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the Windows directory (usually \Windows), find some file with 
  the extension .bmp and double-click it.</li>
  <li>In the dialog that appears, select the only structure in the list 
  (BITMAPFILEHEADER) and click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you should see the BMP file displayed in Structorian:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Structorian01.gif" width="630" height="414"></p>
<p>Now let's look more closely at the structure definition file that you have 
just entered. As you can probably see, we have defined one structure, called 
<code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>, consisting of five fields. For each field, we 
have specified a type and a name. The type and the name are separated with a 
space, and fields are separated from each other by semicolons. </p>

<p>The field type determines how many bytes the 
field occupies and how its content is presented to the user. The fields of types 
<code>u32</code> and <code>x32</code> occupy 4 bytes (32 bits) each, and the fields 
of type <code>u16</code> occupy 2 bytes (16 bits). You can easily see that by 
clicking any of the fields: when you do that, the bytes corresponding to the 
field are highlighted in the hex dump. The fields of types <code>u32</code> and 
<code>u16</code> are shown as decimal numbers (<b>u</b>nsigned), and the field of 
type <code>x32</code> is shown as he<b>x</b>adecimal.</p>

<p>The field name is just a string describing the field. If the field name 
contains spaces or other characters that are not letters or numbers, it should 
be enclosed in quotation marks, like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>u16 &quot;Bytes on the last page&quot;;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For some fields, the field type alone is not sufficient to display the data, 
and additional information is needed. That information is specified in field <i>
attributes</i>. An example of the attribute usage is the first field in the 
structure. It has the type <code>str</code> and the name <code>bfType</code>, 
and the attribute <code>len</code> with the value of 2. This means that the 
field denotes a string with the length of 2 bytes, and the name of that string 
is bfType. And as we can see in the example above, the string consists of the 
characters BM, just like the Microsoft documentation says.</p>

<p>The syntax of the .strs files is completely described in the reference 
section, but for now let's mention that a field can have many attributes 
separated with commas, and attribute blocks can be located anywhere in the field 
declarations. So the following lines are equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[readonly=1, len=2] str bfType;
[readonly=1] str [len=2] bfType;
str bfType [len=2,readonly=1];</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Structures can also have attributes. The complete list of attributes for 
structures and all field types can be found in the reference section.</p>

<h2>3. Structure Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Of course, very few files can be described with a single structure. The .BMP 
file format is no exception: the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure is followed with a 
BITMAPINFOHEADER structure. So how do we describe this layout in Structorian?</p>
<p>First, let's describe the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure itself. Add the 
following text to the structure definition file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>struct BITMAPINFOHEADER
{
  u32 biSize;
  i32 biWidth;
  i32 biHeight;
  u16 biPlanes;
  u16 biBitCount;
  u32 biCompression;
  u32 biSizeImage;
  i32 biXPelsPerMeter;
  i32 biYPelsPerMeter;
  u32 biClrUsed;
  u32 biClrImportant;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this structure uses a third type of integer fields - signed integer 
fields, <code>i32</code>. Unlike <code>u32</code> fields, these fields can have
negative values.</p>
<p>Save the file as bmp2.strs. Load it in Structorian. (You don't need to close 
the data file when you load a different structure definitions file. However, the 
current structure will be closed, and you will need to select it again.)</p>
<p>Try selecting the structure manually. Double-click the byte in the hex dump 
at the offset 14 (second byte from the right in the first row). You can see that 
now two structures are shown in the &quot;Select a structure&quot; dialog, and the Offset 
edit box shows the offset that you clicked. Select the structure 
BITMAPINFOHEADER and click OK. Now you should see the BITMAPINFOHEADER data.</p>
<p>Since real-life files often contain hundreds or even thousands of structures, 
selecting each of them manually would be incredibly tedious. The good thing is, 
you don't have to. If you describe the file layout in the Structorian script, 
Structorian will show all the structures in the file automatically.</p>
<p>Structorian represents the data file as a <i>hierarchy</i> of structures. A 
single top-level structure typically describes the file header and starts at the 
beginning of the file (at offset 0). That structure can specify the offsets and 
types of other structures in the file (called <i>child</i> structures). These other structures can point to even 
deeper structures, and so on. There is no limit on the number of levels in the 
hierarchy or on the number of structures at each level. However, the top level 
can have only one structure.</p>
<p>To point from a structure to another structure, the <code>child</code> field is used. 
This is a hidden field; you don't see it in the grid of fields. Usually, a <code>child</code>
field specifies the name of the child structure, the starting offset and the 
number of times the child structure is repeated. However, in our case, the child 
structure immediately follows the parent and is repeated only once, so we can 
specify only the child structure name. </p>

<p>Add the following line to the description of the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure, 
just before the closing curly brace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>child BITMAPINFOHEADER;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Save the result as bmp3.strs. Load it in Structorian. Select the structure 
BITMAPFILEHEADER at offset 0.</p>
<p>You can see that Structorian shows two structures in the file now. If you 
click the second structure in the pane, you will see its contents:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Structorian02.gif" width="630" height="414"></p>
<p>More complex examples of child field usage can be found in the sample files 
provided with Structorian.</p>

<h2>4. Enums</h2>
<p>Consider the biCompression field in the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure. 
Currently, Structorian shows it as just a number. However, the Microsoft 
documentation states that it can have one of a certain set of values. Let's see 
how we can represent this in Structorian.</p>
<p>First, we need to describe the set of values for this field. The list of 
constants and corresponding values can be found in the Microsoft documentation and in the file WinGDI.h. In 
Structorian, this set will be represented by an <i>enum</i> block. Enum blocks 
are not included in structures, but are top-level blocks, just like <code>struct</code> 
blocks.</p>

<p>Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>enum biCompression_Type
{
  BI_RGB, BI_RLE8, BI_RLE4, BI_BITFIELDS, BI_JPEG, BI_PNG
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The constants correspond to values from 0 to 5, so we don't need to specify 
the values explicitly. However, if the constants correspond to different values, 
we need to specify the values explicitly, like in the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>enum PEResourceType
{
  RT_CURSOR=1, RT_BITMAP, RT_ICON, RT_GROUPCURSOR=12, RT_GROUPICON=14
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have defined the enum values, we can replace the integer field 
with an enum field. Find the following line in the file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>u32 biCompression;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Replace it with:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>enum32 biCompression [enum=biCompression_Type];</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Save the file as bmp4.strs. Load it in Structorian.</p>
<p>Notice that the field still occupies 32 bits, or 4 bytes. The reference to 
the list of values is specified in the <code>enum</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Now, instead of a number, Structorian shows the constant corresponding to 
that value:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Structorian03.gif" width="238" height="62"></p>

<h2>5. Conditions and Expressions</h2>
<p>As we move further in describing the BMP file format, we find out that the 
BITMAPINFOHEADER structure is followed by the color palette. However, we cannot 
simply use the <code>child</code> field to describe the color palette, because 
the type and number of structures is determined by certain fields in the 
BITMAPINFOHEADER structure. To describe this, we will need to use <i>conditions</i> 
and <i>expressions</i>. Note that expressions are one of the most powerful 
features of Structorian, and understanding expressions is essential for working 
with complex file formats.</p>

<p>Let's start with describing a simple case: The palette consists of 16 RGBQUAD 
structures for files where biBitCount is equal to 4 and of 256 RGBQUAD 
structures for files where biBitCount is equal to 8.</p>

<p>First, let's describe the RGBQUAD structure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>struct RGBQUAD
{
  u8 rgbBlue;
  u8 rgbGreen;
  u8 rgbRed;
  u8 rgbReserved;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is pretty straightforward here. The new field type <code>u8</code> is a 8-bit 
(1-byte) unsigned integer field. If you prefer to view color components as 
hexadecimal numbers, you can use the field  type <code>x8</code> instead.</p>

<p>To describe the conditional part of the structure, we will use a <code>switch</code> 
field. Just like the switch statement in C, this field calculates an expression 
and selects one of the cases depending on the value of the expression.</p>

<p>Add the following text to the end of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure 
definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>switch (biBitCount)
{
  case (4)
  {
    child RGBQUAD [count=16];
  }
  case (8)
  {
    child RGBQUAD [count=256];
  }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the <code>switch</code> and <code>case</code> fields contain other fields. 
Such fields are called <i>container fields</i>. The contents of a container 
field must be enclosed in curly braces, even if there is only one field in the 
container.</p>

<p>The expression to be evaluated is specified after the <code>switch</code> 
field. </p>
<p>THIS SECTION IS INCOMPLETE. IT WILL BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE RELEASE OF 
STRUCTORIAN VERSION 1.0.</p>
